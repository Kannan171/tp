## Design

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="450" />

The **_Architecture Diagram_** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-F10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/syncsquad/teamsync/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-F10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/syncsquad/teamsync/MainApp.java)) is responsible for the app launch and shutdown.

- At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
- At shutdown, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following five components:

- [**`View (FXML + Controller)`**](#view-component-fxml--controller): The UI presentation of the app.
- [**`Viewmodel`**](#viewmodel-component): Manages the presentation logic and state of the UI.
- [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
- [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the app in memory.
- [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `person delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="750" />

Each of the five main components (also shown in the diagram above),

- defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
- implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point).

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### View component (FXML + Controller)

This component represents the View component of the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture. It is responsible for:

- Rendering the user interface and handling user input
- Displaying data from the ViewModel
- Converting user actions into commands that are sent to the ViewModel
- Updating the UI in response to data changes in the ViewModel

This separation of concerns allows the View to focus purely on presentation while delegating data handling to the ViewModel.

![Summarised Structure of the View Layer](images/BetterUiClassDiagram.png)

The View component is initialized through the [`Ui`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-F10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/syncsquad/teamsync/controller/Ui.java) interface, which serves as the entry point for UI initialization.

The UI consists of a `MainWindowController` that is made up of these other `Controller Classes`:
- `CommandBoxController`
- `HelpWindowController`
- `MeetingTreeViewController`
- `PersonTreeViewController`
- `ResultDisplayController`
- `StatusBarFooterController`
- `TimetableController`

All the `Controller Classes`, including the `MainWindowController`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `Controller` classes are built using the JavaFX UI framework, where each UI component's layout is defined in corresponding `.fxml` files located in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. These controllers manage user interactions and communicate with the ViewModel component. For instance, the [`MainWindowController`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-F10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/syncsquad/teamsync/controller/MainWindowController.java) has its layout defined in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-F10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml).

We make use of AtlantaFX Styles to style in-line in controller files as much as possible. FXML files are used to embed controller logic and are intended to be thin UI wireframes, as opposed to fully fledged interfaces.

### ViewModel component

The ViewModel component serves as the intermediary between the View and Model components in the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture. It is responsible for:

- Managing the presentation logic and state of the UI
- Converting data from the Model into a format suitable for display
- Handling user input and converting it into commands for the Logic component
- Maintaining the state of UI components
- Providing data bindings for the View component

![Structure of the ViewModel Layer](images/ViewModelClassDiagram.png)

The ViewModel component consists of several specialized view models:

- **`MainViewModel`**: The central view model that coordinates all other view models and manages the overall application state.
- **`CommandBoxViewModel`**: Handles the command input functionality, managing the command text and execution.
- **`ResultDisplayViewModel`**: Manages the display of command results and feedback messages.
- **`PersonListViewModel`**: Handles the presentation logic for the person list, including filtering and sorting.
- **`MeetingListViewModel`**: Manages the display and state of meetings, including scheduling and conflicts.
- **`CurrentWeekViewModel`**: Handles the display of the current week's schedule and time-related information.

Each view model:

- Depends on the Model component for data
- Provides observable properties that the View can bind to
- Handles the conversion of Model data into displayable formats
- Manages the state of its corresponding UI component
- Communicates with the Logic component for command execution

The ViewModel component follows these design principles:

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each view model is responsible for a specific aspect of the UI
2. **Data Binding**: Uses JavaFX's property system for automatic UI updates
3. **Dependency Management**: Maintains clear dependencies on Model and Logic components
4. **State Management**: Handles UI state independently of the View component

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-F10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/syncsquad/teamsync/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The Logic component is responsible for:

- Processing user commands and executing them
- Managing the command parsing and execution flow
- Coordinating between the ViewModel and Model components
- Handling command validation and error checking
- Providing feedback on command execution results

The Logic component consists of several key components:

- **`LogicManager`**: The main implementation of the `Logic` interface that orchestrates command execution
- **`Messages`**: Contains common message strings used throughout the application
- **Command Parsers**: Located in the `parser` package, responsible for parsing user input into executable commands
- **Commands**: Located in the `commands` package, implementing the actual command logic

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When a command is received from the ViewModel component, the `LogicManager` processes it through the following steps:

   - The command string is passed to the appropriate parser in the `parser` package
   - The parser validates the command format and parameters
   - A corresponding `Command` object is created
   - The command is executed, interacting with the Model component as needed
   - A `CommandResult` is returned to the ViewModel component

2. The command execution flow:

   - Commands can modify the Model's state (e.g., adding/removing persons, meetings)
   - Commands can query the Model for information
   - Commands can trigger UI updates through the ViewModel
   - All command results include feedback messages for the user

3. Error handling:
   - Invalid commands are caught and reported with helpful error messages
   - Command-specific validation ensures data integrity
   - Exceptions are properly handled and converted to user-friendly messages

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:

- When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
- All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-F10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/syncsquad/teamsync/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

The Model component is responsible for:

- Managing the application's data and business logic
- Maintaining data integrity and consistency
- Providing data access and manipulation methods
- Supporting data observation through observable properties
- Managing user preferences and settings

The Model component consists of several key components:

- **`ModelManager`**: The main implementation of the `Model` interface that manages all data operations
- **`AddressBook`**: The central data structure that holds all application data
- **`UniqueItemList`**: A generic list implementation that ensures uniqueness of items
- **`UserPrefs`**: Manages user preferences and settings

The Model component is organized into several packages:

- **`person`**: Contains classes related to person management
- **`meeting`**: Contains classes related to meeting management
- **`module`**: Contains classes related to module management
- **`tag`**: Contains classes related to tag management
- **`util`**: Contains utility classes used across the model

Key features of the Model component:

1. **Data Management**:

   - Stores and manages all application data (persons, meetings, modules, etc.) in storage component
   - Ensures data consistency and integrity
   - Provides methods for data manipulation and retrieval
   - Maintains relationships between different data entities

2. **Observable Properties**:

   - Exposes data through observable lists for UI binding
   - Notifies observers of data changes
   - Supports filtered views of data
   - Enables real-time UI updates

3. **Data Access**:

   - Provides read-only interfaces for data access
   - Implements data validation and constraints
   - Supports data filtering and searching
   - Manages data relationships and dependencies

4. **User Preferences**:
   - Stores user-specific settings in storage component
   - Provides read-only access to preferences
   - Supports preference modification
   - Persists preferences across sessions

The Model component follows these design principles:

1. **Encapsulation**: Data access is controlled through well-defined interfaces
2. **Immutability**: Data objects are immutable to ensure consistency
3. **Dependency Inversion**: Higher-level components depend on abstractions
4. **Single Responsibility**: Each class has a specific, well-defined purpose

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The Model component is designed to be only dependent on the Storage component, allowing it to be tested and modified without affecting the rest of the application.
</div>

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-F10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/syncsquad/teamsync/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The Storage component is responsible for:

- Persisting application data to and from the file system
- Managing data serialization and deserialization
- Handling data format conversion
- Providing data backup and recovery capabilities
- Managing user preferences storage

The Storage component consists of several key components:

- **`StorageManager`**: The main implementation of the `Storage` interface that coordinates all storage operations
- **`JsonAddressBookStorage`**: Handles the storage of address book data in JSON format
- **`JsonUserPrefsStorage`**: Manages the storage of user preferences in JSON format
- **`JsonSerializableAddressBook`**: Represents the serializable version of the address book
- **`JsonAdaptedPerson`**: Handles the conversion between Person objects and JSON
- **`JsonAdaptedMeeting`**: Handles the conversion between Meeting objects and JSON
- **`JsonAdaptedModule`**: Handles the conversion between Module objects and JSON
- **`JsonAdaptedTag`**: Handles the conversion between Tag objects and JSON

Key features of the Storage component:

1. **Data Persistence**:

   - Saves application data to JSON files
   - Loads data from JSON files
   - Maintains data integrity during save/load operations
   - Handles file I/O operations safely

2. **Data Conversion**:

   - Converts between Java objects and JSON format
   - Handles complex object relationships
   - Maintains data consistency during conversion
   - Validates data during deserialization

3. **User Preferences**:

   - Stores user preferences in a separate file
   - Loads preferences on application startup
   - Updates preferences when modified
   - Maintains preference consistency

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Handles file system errors gracefully
   - Provides meaningful error messages
   - Maintains data integrity during errors
   - Supports data recovery when possible

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The Storage component is designed to be independent of the Model component's implementation details, allowing for changes in the data model without affecting storage operations.
</div>

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are organized in the `syncsquad.teamsync.commons` package, which is divided into several subpackages:

1. **`core`**:

   - Contains fundamental classes that define the core behavior of the application
   - Provides base classes and interfaces used across different components
   - Defines common data structures and utilities

2. **`exceptions`**:

   - Contains custom exception classes used throughout the application
   - Provides specialized exception handling for different scenarios
   - Includes error messages and recovery suggestions

3. **`util`**:
   - Contains utility classes and helper methods
   - Provides common functionality used across different components
   - Includes string manipulation, date handling, and other utility functions

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The Common classes are designed to be independent of specific components, allowing them to be used across the entire application without creating unnecessary dependencies.
</div>

## Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

There are 4 main command groups:

- Teammate (`person`)
- Module (`module`)
- Meeting (`meeting`)
- General

<!--div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** Some note here.

</div-->

### Teammate

<img src="images/PersonClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

A Teammate is represented by a `Person` object, and is composed of several attributes. All `Person` objects are stored in a  `UniquePersonList`, which interacts with the `AddressBook` class in the [Model component](#model-component).

The attributes of the `Person` class represent:
- `Name`: The name of the teammate.
- `Phone`: The phone number of the teammate.
- `Email`: The email address of the teammate.
- `Address`: The address of the teammate.
- `Module`: The set of modules taken by the teammate.
- `Tag`: The set of tags that are related to the teammate.

<div markdown="1" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** See the [glossary](#glossary) for how duplicate teammates are identified.
</div>

#### Adding a new teammate

The command `person add` creates a new `Person` object, which contains the necessary fields that are associated with a teammate.

The activity diagram is represented below:

<img src="images/PersonAddActivityDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram of the command is represented below:

<img src="images/AddPersonCommandSequenceDiagram.png" width="750"/>

<div markdown="1" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:**<br>
* The lifeline for `PersonCommandsParser`, `AddPersonCommandParser` and `AddPersonCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.

* The sequence diagram does not show the instantiation of classes that represents the attributes of the `Person` object, as their behaviour is trivial and will clutter the diagram.
</div>

The method call `AddPersonCommandParser.parse()` was simplified and the validation checks for the attributes were ommited, as it would clutter the diagram. The full behaviour of the parser is described below:

<img src="images/AddPersonCommandSequenceDiagram2.png" width="750"/>

<div markdown="1" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:**

The following restrictions apply to the attributes:

* Names should only contain alphanumeric characters, spaces, and the following special characters (`'`,`/` and `-`).

* Phone numbers should only contain numbers, and it should be at least 3 digits long.

* Emails should be of the format local-part@domain.

* Tags should only contain alphanumeric characters.

* Users should avoid using [command line flag patterns](#glossary) as they _might_ cause an error.

## Appendix: Planned Enhancements

Team size: 5

1. **Support multiple timings associated with each module**. Currently, it is only possible to associate one time interval with each module.

   We plan to allow multiple timings to be associated with each module, so that TeamSync can account for multiple lessons, tutorials, labs or recitations in a week.
2. **Add failsafe for corrupted data file**. Currently, if the data file is corrupted or cannot be loaded, TeamSync starts up with empty data. If a user were to run any commands that modify data, the old data will be permanently lost. This is mainly an issue when a user manually edits the data file.

   We plan to implement a failsafe where TeamSync saves a backup file and loads from that in the case of data corruption.

3. **Fix GUI appearing off-screen**. Currently, the GUI may appear off-screen when using multiple screens. In such cases user will have to manually delete the preferences file to fix this issue.

   We plan to have TeamSync handle these cases automatically when starting up.

4. **Flexible search terms**. Currently, TeamSync's `person find` only matches teammates whose name contain an exact match with one of the keywords.

   We plan to make the search more flexible. For example, searching `al` should also display `alex`.
5. **Search with other fields** Currently, TeamSync's `person find` only searches for teammates by name.

   We plan to improve on its functionality by allowing `person find` to search by additional fields, such as tags, modules, etc.

6. **Allow modules to span across multiple days**. Currently, modules cannot span multiple days. For example, it is not possible to have a module from `Thu 22:00` to `Fri 02:00`.

   We plan to allow modules to span multiple days.
7. **Allow meetings to span across multiple days**. Currently, meetings cannot span multiple days. For example, it is not possible to have a module from `08-04-2025 22:00` to `09-04-2025 02:00`.

   We plan to allow meetings to span multiple days.

8. **Allow meetings to be associated with specific teammates**. Currently, meetings is associated with the entire contact list.

   We plan to allow meetings to be associated with specific teammates to account for cases where only a part of the team needs to meet.

9. **Modify `clear` command to allow for undo**. Currently, the `clear` command is irreversible. This might be a problem if a user accidentally deletes all their data but wants it back.

   We plan to modify the `clear` command to support undoing.

10. **More permissive names**. Currently, names only allow alphanumeric and certain special characters.

    We plan to allow names to be made up of a larger variety of characters, including non-latin alphabets and other special symbols.

## Appendix: Effort

### Difficulty Level

Our project is significantly more advanced than AB3, featuring new commands and enhanced functionalities. Student objects now include a modules attribute for schedule coordination, and common meetings can also be scheduled. The UI is also more complex, incorporating a timetable view that displays shared schedules and scheduled meetings for the week.

### Challenges Faced

UI update: Providing a fresh look for the application with colours more appealing than AB3 as well as the new timetable view required multiple revisions.\
Schedule logic: Introduction of logic for modules and meetings required careful planning on implementation as well as how to display them in the application

### Effort Required

Our project involved substantial effort in several key areas:

Refactoring: Codebase was refactored to MVVM architecture to better facilitate development\
Commands: Multiple new commands were added and existing commands modified to better suit our application\
UI: Effort was required for the new timetable view and how schedules were displayed as well as the ability to modify the current view

### Achievements

We have enhanced the AB3 application with new features and design to better suit project management of NUS students.
